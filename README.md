# Roller Shadowcaster (Raph)
This mod adds a custom character to Don't Starve Together with a playstyle centered around mobility and shadow invocation.

## Characteristic:
- The character is always on rollers, granting increased movement.
- A special item in the inventory allows the character to invoke shadow creatures that fight for her like Abigail for Wendy. Each invocation costs 25% of her current sanity.

- Naturally resistant to freezing temperatures.

- Suffers double the effects from heatr.

- When her sanity is greater than 50%, she emits a small sanity aura that helps nearby players regain their sanity.
